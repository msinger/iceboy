c - continue:
  * halt=0

s - step:
  * let go of halt for one tick
  * drive data according to command d (see below)
  * sample probe for 24 ticks and shift it out on uart

d - drive data:
  * receive 3+24 bytes from uart
  * 3 bytes (24 bit) for selecting on which tick data gets driven by the debugger
  * 24 bytes for the data being driven by the debugger on each tick of a step

i/I - increment PC:
  * lower case i disables PC increment
  * upper case I enables PC increment

A BREAK signal halts the CPU; this way it can be haltet directly out of RESET.
BREAK can also be used to bring the receiver of the debugger in a known idle state.
